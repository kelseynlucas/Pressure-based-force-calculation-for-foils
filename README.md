# Pressure-based-force-calculation-for-foils
Scripts used alongside John Dabiri's queen2 (http://dabirilab.com/software/), an algorithm which calculates pressure fields from PIV velocity fields, to calculate forces and torques on flat hydrofoils operated by a mechanical flapping foil apparatus


autokinematicsandpressureintegrator_nopressure_readsplines files read in splines files generated by the auto foil kinematics vi (available on kelseynlucas' GitHub), and dilates these lines to a loop which encloses the foil.  The new foil outline will be wide enough to enclose vectors in the PIV vector fields - if the outline does not enclose vectors, queen2 essentially cannot see the foil.
_gap version does this for a foil with a fish-like tail-shape, with a front "body" and back "tail" parts in the PIV laser sheet, but not the peduncle between the body and the tail.

autokinematicsandpressureintegrator_readsplines_cb files read in queen2 pressure fields and the splines from auto foil kinematics vi, and plot pressure fields in a ColorBrewer palette (requires https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer---colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab ).  They also use pressure and foil span & foil kinematics information to calculate forces and torques acting on the foil.
_varyinght version does this for the fish-like tail-shaped foil, which has varying "height" (span), when the PIV laser is positioned at the foil's midline.
_gap version does this for the fish-like tail-shaped foil, which has varying "height" (span), when the PIV laser is positioned to cross the gap between the body and tail.
